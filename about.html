<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="./hazel pic.jpg" height="200" />
<p>I am a hard working, honest individual. I am a good timekeeper, always willing to learn new skills. I am friendly, helpful and polite, have a good sense of humour. I am able to work independently in busy environments and also within a team setting.</p>

<p>In my free time I enjoy walking, walking provides the best of both worlds. It offers the physical benefits of exercise while also boosting your emotional well-being. I also enjoy watching movies and playing with my dog, it relieves stress, and it provides plenty of opportunities to work on some training. </p>
